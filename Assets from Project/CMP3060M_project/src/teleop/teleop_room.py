Brief Description
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This script will allow for the teleoperation of the PWC and room selection within the household. It is 
possible to do this by using an Xbox 360 controller and the joy package. Specific buttons on the control
(Xbox power on/off, A, B, X and Y) call other scripts, when pressed. These scripts navigate to a goal,
which has been set in each of the assigned rooms. Autonomy is used to follow a planned path and reach the
desired location, entered by the user.

2. Assigned Velocities
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This sets the cmd_vel (command velocity) to:
	- linear velocity (Measured in Metres) = travels/moves forward at 40 centimetres per second 
	- angular velocity (Measured in Radians) = rotates 0.5 radians per second (approx 30 degrees p/s)

Note: The maximum angular velociy for a TB2 is 3.1 radians (approx) or 180 degrees p/s.
	  The PWC rotates at a speed of ....research

	How User Input is Received:
	___________________________

	The attribute .axes is imported with the Joy package. This refers to the axis of the xbox controller.
	There is an array of 8 variables, which include the joysticks, triggers and D-Pad/Cross keys of the
	controller. For the purpose of this study, the left thumstick will be used. The left/right movement
	of the left stick is position [0] of the array and up/down motion is position [1]. 
	
	(ROS.org, 2019)

	The code below takes the input of the user and multiplies the rate by an assigned value. This allows
	the PWC to move at very specific speeds using the Twist topic. Twist is re-assigned to tele_vq and 
	allows it to access the linear and angular attributes. The linear velocity commands move the robot 
	along x-axis within 3D space. While angular velocity commands are processed along the z-axis, as the 
	robot must simply rotate and not travel in any direction.  
	""" 
	tele_vq.linear.x = left_stick.axes[1] * assign_vel[0]
	tele_vq.angular.z = left_stick.axes[0] * assign_vel[1] 

	"""
	The below, loginfo attribute from the rospy pkg, will publish the outputs for linear and angular 
	velocity. As an example:
	
	If the PWC is traveling forwards for 3 seconds the terminal will display: 
		
		"tele_vq.linear: 0.8 ; angular 0.0"

	The same can be applied for a rotation for 2 seconds, which would display:

		"tele_vq.linear: 0.0 ; angular 1.0"
